		 * Population

		 * Population = new Popualtion();
		 * Selection = new Selection(Population);
		 * Mutation = new Mutation();
		 * Fitness f = new Fitness();
		 * Replacement  r= new Replacement();
		 * 
		 * This should all run in a loop.

		 * 
		 * Grading Scheme:
		 * 
		 * Data abstraction used appropriately throughout
		 * 
		 * Information hiding present and appropriate throughout
		 * 
		 * Separation of behavior and implementation particularly with respect to the Strategy & Factory design patterns
		 * 
		 * Multiple-file or multiple-module programming solution submitted - classes, subclasses (class hierarchies/inheritance), generics and polymorphism used appropriately to reuse existing design and code throughout.
		 * 
		 * Programming solution submitted creates data structures that can be objectively judged to be cohesive (facilitate maintenance), facilitate reuse/extensibility, adhere to the principle of substitutability and the open-closed principle ï¿½ and reuse existing libraries where appropriate.
		 *
		 *
		 *Singleton pattern correctly applied to allow a single instance of a class to be created only.
		 *
		 *Strategy pattern correctly applied to allow dynamic change of behaviour at runtime
		 *
		 *Factory pattern correctly applied to handle instantiation of GA operator objects.
